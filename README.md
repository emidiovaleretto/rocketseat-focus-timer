# Description

The Focus Timer is a web application designed to help users manage their time more effectively by using the Pomodoro technique. This technique involves working for a set period of time, usually 25 minutes, and then taking a short break before starting the next work session.

# Features

- Stopwatch: The centerpiece of the application is a stopwatch that counts down from a user-defined time (default is 25 minutes). The remaining time is displayed prominently in the center of the screen.

- Set Time: Users can easily customize the duration of their work session by clicking the stopwatch button. They can enter any desired time in minutes. If the input is not a valid number, or if nothing is entered, the application will continue with the previously set time.

- Visual and Audio Cues: When the remaining time drops below 10 seconds, the numbers turn red to visually alert the user that time is running out. Additionally, a sound is played to indicate the end of the work session.

- Sound Control: Users have the option to enable background music by clicking the volume button located at the bottom of the screen. By default, the background music is turned off.
